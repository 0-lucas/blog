			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			<p>This one is my fault. I really need to organize and publish the projects i study.
				For now, there're still some that are already published:
			</p>

			<h2>
				<a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/0-lucas/ProjetoAvanti"> Sign Language Classification</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				This is my first contact with <i>neural networks</i>. It's a end-to-end project which
				collects data from the Kaggle API, analyze it, trains a deep learning model,
				and then serve it using an executable or StreamLit.
				It translates images and videos containing American Sign Language into a alphabetical letter.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<a class="text-link" href="https://medium.com/@luccleandro">Medium posts</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				I've made some posts to Medium about some Machine Learning content. I'm really proud
				of the Linear Regression one (check it out!).
			</p>

			<h2>
				<a class="text-link" href="https://0-lucas.github.io/digital-garden/">Knowledge Management</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				This one is not exactly a project, but it's continuous progress that i'm doing daily.
				As the name implies, i use some markdown notes as a way to study and consult what i've already
				studied. I plan to train a language model on it at the end of the year, which i think will be really
				cool!

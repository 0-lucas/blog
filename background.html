			<h1>My background</h1>
			<p>
				Even though i'm currently pursuing an associate degree in Data Science, most of time i'm
				self-teaching <i>Machine Learning, mathematics, and programming</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started with an associate degree in Mechanics, working with industrial maintenance.
				After a couple of years,I got a job at a metalurgy company, working with maintenance planning, but i
				didn't spend a lot of time there.
				Then i began to study Mechatronics, working with process engineering at Bosch.
				There, i really took a liking to mess with Excel data and automate daily routines,
				which led me to study <i>Python and Data Analysis</i> extensively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, i applly this knowledge at Dell, as a Data intern. I'm also just starting to volunteer at
				a local NGO, <a class="text-link" href="https://gprimavera.org.br/">Grupo Primavera</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm really passionate about <i>Statistics and Machine Learning</i>, trying to improve myself daily,
				and documenting my progress using <a class="text-link"
					href="https://0-lucas.github.io/digital-garden/">knowledge management</a>
				and smart notes. Feel free to check it ou!
